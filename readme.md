Test NodeJS authentication API
===============
 A simple NodeJS stack for attaching to an LDAP server, and authenticating users, returning JWTs, and even a little test proxy (haproxy) so I could know headers were coming through right.

  I don't remember exactly where I left off - so don't expect the world - but it should be a good starting point. 

  Also... still learning node and it's ecosystem. Probably not a good idea to follow my patterns.
